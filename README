CPAN-Checksums-Signature version 0.01
=====================================

Proposal for verifying CHECKSUMS distributed on CPAN.

Supports signature verifcation via GnuPG v1 or GnuPG v2. This module contains
the PAUSE PGP signing key for trust.

Crypt::OpenPGP support has been removed due to no support for SHA2.
